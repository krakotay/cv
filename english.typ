        = Summary
        
        A System Administrator with hands-on experience managing IT infrastructure for small and medium-sized businesses. Maintained a fleet of over 70 computers and laptops, built systems from the ground up—including a full office setup—and established secure site-to-site VPN connections using Mikrotik.

        Experienced in deploying 1C and MSSQL servers on both physical hardware and virtual environments. Developed small software solutions tailored to business needs—automating Excel reporting, integrating with APIs, and streamlining routine processes.

        Provided IT consulting to more than 75 clients—individuals, entrepreneurs, and companies—advising on solution selection, security, modernization, and cost optimization.

        Fluent in English: capable of reading technical documentation, correspondence, and calls without an interpreter. Accent present but fully understood by native speakers.

        I believe initiative, reliability, and the ability to “handle everything at once”—from cabling to automation—are key. That’s the versatile approach I practice.
